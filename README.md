Program for read a file path .csv
with the data of itens sold. Each item have a
name, unit price and quantity, separated by comma. I generated
a new file called "summary.csv", located in a
subfolder called "out" from the original folder from the source file,
containing only the name and the total value for that item
(unit price multiplied for quantity).
